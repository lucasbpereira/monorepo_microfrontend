This is a monorepo made to showcase my skills with microfrontends using Angular Module Federation.

> ⚠️ **Important Notice:**  
> I understand that using a monorepo is not necessarily the best approach to structure projects on GitHub.  
> However, the purpose of this repository is purely to demonstrate the use of **Module Federation** with **Angular** and how it can be applied to build a microfrontend architecture.
